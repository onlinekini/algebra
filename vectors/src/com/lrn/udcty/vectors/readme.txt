Linear equation is where => You can add/subtract variables & constants or multiply or divide by constants (not variables).
x/y + 1 = 4 is not a linear equation as we are dividing by variable. However (x/3) + y = Z is a linear equation.

y = mx + b universal definition of the line. Where m = is the slope of the line and b is the base point on the y axis. But this cannot define a vertical line.
Ax+By=K is a better notation. Both A and B cannot be zero at the same time.

To find the direction vector of the line ... 
Ax + By = 0 can be considered. This being the same line which is passing thru the origin and no other change. Hence the two lines are similar.
 
Using the DOT product definition :
Ax + By can be represented as [A B] . [x y] (matrix notation).
So As per matix definition. [A B] . [x y] = 0 (as per Ax + By = 0) means, [x y] vector is orthogonal to [A B] vector. 
Hence [x y] becomes the direction vector
Since Ax+B =0 and Ax+By=6 are same lines just different positions => [x y] vector would be direction vector to BOTH the lines.
what is value of [x y] ?
As per vectors -> just flip and negate => [B -A] is the orthogonal vector for [A B].

BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
 
Two LINEAR lines are parallel or intersecting ONCE or they are the same line. Cannot be anything else.
How do we find if the lines are same => TWO PARALLEL lines are equal (or same) if te vector connecting one point on each line is orthogonal to BOTH lines.
If they are just parallel, then the lines connecting the two points will NOT be orthogonal to either of the lines as. 


IDentify the intersection of TWO non parallel lines
Ax + By = k1 
Cx + Dy = k2  

x = Dk1-Bk2/(AD -BC)
y = -Ck1 + Ak2/(AD -BC). 

Derivation is in Chapter 3 second half.
